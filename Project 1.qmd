2.  Build a website using Quarto
3.  Include a README.md file
4.  Deploy your website
5.  Share your website

## Part 3

1.  Use [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget) to download the `students.csv` file locally from [here](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatprogramming2024/blob/main/projects/01-project/students.csv).

    ```{bash}

    # Check if students.csv file exists to prevent downloading each time 

    if [ ! -f "students.csv" ]; then 
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatprogramming2024/main/projects/01-project/students.csv

    else
        echo "students.csv already exists."
    fi
    ```

2.  Display the contents of the `students.csv` file using the `cat` command.

    ```{bash}
    cat students.csv # print the contents of the students.csv
    ```

3.  Display only the first 5 lines of the file using `head` to show the first few lines.

    ```{bash}
    head -n 5 students.csv # display the first 5 lines 
    ```

4.  Display only the last 3 lines of the file using `tail` to show the last few lines.

    ```{bash}
    tail -n 3 students.csv # display the last 3 lines 
    ```

5.  Count the number of lines in the file using the `wc` command to count the lines.

    ```{bash}
    wc -l students.csv # count the number of lines 
    ```

6.  Find all students who are taking “Math” as a subject using `grep` to filter lines with the subject “Math”.

    ```{bash}
    grep "Math" students.csv # find students who are taking "Math"
    ```

7.  Find all female students using `grep` or `awk` to filter based on gender.

    ```{bash}
    awk -F, '$4 == "F" {print}' students.csv # find all female students
    ```

8.  Sort the file by the students’ ages in ascending order. Use `sort` to order by the “Age” column.

    ```{bash}
    sort -t, -k3,3n students.csv # sort by students' ages in ascending order
      ## -t, delimiter 
      ## -k3,3 sort using the third column
      ## n sort in numerical order 
    ```

9.  Find the unique subjects listed in the file. Use `cut`, `sort`, and `uniq` to extract unique subjects.

    ```{bash}
    cut -d, -f6 students.csv | sort | uniq # find unique subjects 
      ## -d, delimiter
      ## -f6 look for subjects in the sixth column 
    ```

10. Calculate the average grade of the students. Use `awk` to sum the grades and divide by the number of students.

    ```{bash}
    awk -F, '{sum += $5} END {print sum / (NR -1)}' students.csv # calculate the average grade of the students 
      ## NR-1 to exclude header when counting the number of rows
    ```

11. Replace all occurrences of “Math” with “Mathematics” in the file. Use `sed` to perform the replacement.

    ```{bash}
    sed 's/Math/Mathematics/g' students.csv # replace "Math" with "Mathematics"
      ## s substitution 
      ## g global flag (replace all occurrences in each line)
    ```
